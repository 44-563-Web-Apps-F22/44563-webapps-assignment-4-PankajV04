        <h3>ACT II - The same Scene, with the Ruins Restored</h3>
        <h5>SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
            of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
            interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
            of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
            back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
            gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
            grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
            drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.</h5>

SILL. Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.

PRET. You certainly are a dear old thing.

MER. Well, you see, there's a good deal to be said on both sides
of the question; you are certainly younger than the original
gods, and, therefore, more active.  On the other hand, they are
certainly older than you, and have, therefore, more experience.
On the whole I prefer you, because your mistakes amuse me.

MER. One year today. How do you like ruling the world?

DAPH. Apollo, then—has treated me. He promised to marry me years
ago and now he's married to Nicemis.

NICE. By this golden wedding ring,
      I'm his wife, and you're a "thing."

JUP. Was it not that Thespis might consult you whenever he was in
     a difficulty?
