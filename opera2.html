        SONG — DEFENDANT

            When first my old, old love I knew,
                 My bosom welled with joy;
            My riches at her feet I threw—
                 I was a love-sick boy!
            No terms seemed too extravagant
                 Upon her to employ—
            I used to mope, and sigh, and pant,
                 Just like a love-sick boy!
                      Tink-a-tank! Tink-a-tank!

            But joy incessant palls the sense;
                 And love, unchanged, will cloy,
            And she became a bore intense
                 Unto her love-sick boy!
            With fitful glimmer burnt my flame,
                 And I grew cold and coy,
            At last, one morning, I became
                 Another's love-sick boy.
                      Tink-a-tank!  Tink-a-tank!</p>
